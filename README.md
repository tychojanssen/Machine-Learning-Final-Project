# Machine Learning Final Project 
Soccer player transfer fee prediction

This project was developed in collaboration with Lucas Alba

# My Responsibilities:

- Responsible for developing machine learning models including linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, tree-based models, and ensemble methods.
- Cleaned, standardized, and preprocessed the Kaggle dataset, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and class imbalances.
- Engineered features to improve model predictive performance.
- Performed model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.

# Best-performing model: Ensemble method, achieving:
- MAE: 2.40×10⁶
- RMSE: 4.77×10⁶
- R² Score: 0.564
